# EKS Dynamo Networking Prerequisites

For `*-eks-ubuntu-inference-dynamo` recipes, `dynamo-platform` commonly runs:
- `etcd` on TCP `2379`
- `nats` (JetStream) on TCP `4222`

If system components and GPU workloads are on different node groups/security groups, these ports may be blocked from GPU nodes to system nodes. Typical symptoms:
- `Unable to create lease` (etcd unreachable)
- `JetStream not available` (NATS unreachable)

The conformance validator's `ai-service-metrics` check adds a third requirement:
it dials Prometheus over the cluster Service (typically
`kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090`). The orchestrator Job that
runs the check tolerates every taint and has no node-affinity toward
Prometheus, so the kube-scheduler may place it on any worker node — including
one whose ENI is in a security group that cannot reach the Prometheus pod.

When that happens, the dial times out at 5 s and the check is marked `failed`:

```text
[SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE] Prometheus unreachable at http://kube-prometheus-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090 — verify network connectivity
```

The outcome is **non-deterministic from run to run** on the same cluster: the
first scheduling decision is a tie-break, and subsequent runs are dominated by
image-locality scoring (whichever node pulled the validator image first keeps
winning). A re-run on a "freshly working" cluster is therefore not a reliable
signal that the SG topology is correct.

This is tracked in [issue #933](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/933);
this page documents the cluster-side prerequisite until the validator gains
`podAffinity` toward Prometheus.

## Required Security Group Rules

Allow ingress from the GPU node security group to the system node security group on:
- TCP `2379` — etcd (dynamo-platform)
- TCP `4222` — NATS / JetStream (dynamo-platform)
- TCP `9090` — Prometheus (required for the `ai-service-metrics` conformance check)

The `9090` rule is symmetrically required: the validator orchestrator pod may
land on **any** worker node, so every node group whose pods can host the
orchestrator must be able to reach the Prometheus pod's IP on `9090`. On
clusters with separate customer/system ENI subnets (e.g. DGXC EKS), this means
the system SG must accept ingress from the customer SG (and any other worker
SG), not only from itself.

If the cluster has more than two worker security groups (e.g. a separate
inference node group), repeat the `9090` rule for each non-system SG that can
host pods — the validator orchestrator has no scheduling preference and may
land on any of them.

Example:

```shell
# 1) Find SG IDs for system and GPU nodegroups
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=<system-nodegroup>" \
  --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" \
  --output text

aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:eks:nodegroup-name,Values=<gpu-nodegroup>" \
  --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups[*].GroupId" \
  --output text

# 2) Allow etcd + NATS + Prometheus from GPU SG -> system SG
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <system-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 2379 --source-group <gpu-sg-id>

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <system-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 4222 --source-group <gpu-sg-id>

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <system-sg-id> \
  --protocol tcp --port 9090 --source-group <gpu-sg-id>
```
