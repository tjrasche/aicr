# Build Provenance Demo

Every released AICR image carries a signed SLSA Build Provenance v1 attestation
and a signed SPDX SBOM, produced by NVIDIA CI on tag and recorded in the public
Rekor transparency log. Released binaries ship a separate SPDX SBOM asset
(`*.sbom.json`) — only the image SBOM uses the signed OCI attestation flow. This demo walks the consumer-side verification
chain — what a downstream operator runs to confirm an artifact came from NVIDIA,
from a known commit, and contains a known software bill of materials.

The producer side runs in `.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml`; nothing here needs
NVIDIA credentials or repo access. The companion script is
[`provenance-demo.sh`](provenance-demo.sh); the slide deck is
[`provenance-demo-slides.html`](provenance-demo-slides.html).

This walkthrough covers:

1. Resolve the latest release tag to an immutable digest.
2. Verify the SLSA Provenance v1 attestation with `gh attestation verify`.
3. Verify the SPDX SBOM attestation with `cosign verify-attestation`.
4. Use the SBOM for vulnerability scanning and license compliance.
5. Audit the signature in the Rekor transparency log.
6. Enforce verification at admission time with Sigstore Policy Controller or Kyverno.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| `curl`, `jq` | Resolve the latest release tag from the GitHub API |
| [`crane`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane) | Resolve mutable tags to immutable digests without pulling layers |
| [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) | Verifies attestations against NVIDIA's identity (`gh attestation verify`) |
| [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) | Verifies SBOM attestations with an explicit signer policy |
| `grype` *(optional)* | SBOM-based vulnerability scan |
| `rekor-cli` *(optional)* | Transparency-log lookup |

This demo uses `gh` and `cosign`, which manage their own Sigstore trust roots,
so no `aicr trust update` is needed.

## 1. Resolve the latest tag to a digest

A registry tag is mutable — anyone with push rights can move it. A digest is a
content hash, so resolving once and pinning everything else to the digest gives
every check the same anchor.

```shell
TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/NVIDIA/aicr/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')
IMAGE=ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr
DIGEST=$(crane digest "${IMAGE}:${TAG}")
IMAGE_DIGEST="${IMAGE}@${DIGEST}"
echo "$IMAGE_DIGEST"
# ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr@sha256:f0c1...
```

The `aicrd` server image is published in lockstep, but its digest is
independent — resolve it separately:

```shell
IMAGE_AICRD=ghcr.io/nvidia/aicrd
DIGEST_AICRD=$(crane digest "${IMAGE_AICRD}:${TAG}")
```

## 2. Verify the image (SLSA Provenance v1)

`gh attestation verify` is the simplest path (run `gh auth login` or set
`GH_TOKEN` first): it fetches the attestation from the GitHub attestations API
by default, validates the Sigstore signature against the Fulcio cert chain and a
Rekor inclusion proof, and enforces that the artifact comes from `--repo`
and was signed by the exact release workflow named in `--signer-workflow`
(pinning `--owner` alone would trust any workflow in any NVIDIA repository).

```shell
gh attestation verify "oci://${IMAGE_DIGEST}" --repo NVIDIA/aicr --signer-workflow NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml --source-ref "refs/tags/${TAG}"
```

Expected output:

```text
Loaded digest sha256:f0c1... for oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr@sha256:f0c1...
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
✓ Verification succeeded!

The following policy criteria will be enforced:
  - OIDC Issuer must match: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  - Source Repository URI must match: https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr
  - Build signer workflow must match: NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml
  - Predicate type must match: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1
```

Same for `aicrd`:

```shell
gh attestation verify "oci://${IMAGE_AICRD}@${DIGEST_AICRD}" --repo NVIDIA/aicr --signer-workflow NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml --source-ref "refs/tags/${TAG}"
```

### Why pin to the digest

A tag-only verify (`oci://ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr:vX.Y.Z`) resolves to whatever
digest the tag points at *now*. If the tag is repointed between resolve and
verify, the two see different artifacts. Always pass `@sha256:...`.

## 3. Verify the SPDX SBOM attestation

Different predicate, same trust model. `cosign verify-attestation` enforces an
explicit signer policy (issuer + identity regex) and writes the verified DSSE
envelope to disk:

```shell
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type spdxjson \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/NVIDIA/aicr/\.github/workflows/on-tag\.yaml@refs/tags/.+$' \
  "${IMAGE_DIGEST}" \
  --output-file predicate.json
```

The output file is a DSSE envelope; the inner `predicate` is the SPDX SBOM:

```shell
jq -r '.payload' predicate.json | base64 -d | jq '.predicate' > sbom.json
```

### Alternative: binary SBOM from the release page

Released binaries carry their SBOM as a separate release asset (not an OCI
attestation). Fetch it directly:

```shell
VERSION=${TAG#v}                                 # strip the 'v' prefix
gh release download "$TAG" \
  --repo NVIDIA/aicr \
  --pattern "aicr_${VERSION}_linux_arm64.sbom.json" \
  --clobber \
  --output sbom.json
```

## 4. SBOM use cases

The image SBOM (OCI attestation) and the binary SBOM (release asset) are
distinct artifacts that share the same SPDX JSON *format*, so downstream tools
work with either.

**Vulnerability scan:**

```shell
grype sbom:./sbom.json
```

Feed the same SBOM to Anchore or Snyk; the format is portable.

**License compliance:**

```shell
jq -r '.packages[]
  | select(.licenseDeclared != "NOASSERTION")
  | "\(.name) \(.versionInfo) \(.licenseDeclared)"' sbom.json
```

**Dependency search (e.g. checking exposure to a named CVE):**

```shell
jq '.packages[] | select(.name | contains("vulnerable-lib"))' sbom.json
```

**Audit trail:**

```shell
jq -r '.creationInfo.created' sbom.json
```

## 5. Audit via Rekor

Rekor is the public, append-only transparency log of every Sigstore signature
ever made. Searching by content digest finds every attestation made against
that artifact — no NVIDIA contact required.

```shell
rekor-cli search --sha "${DIGEST#sha256:}"
# Found matching entries (listed by UUID):
# 24296fb24b8ad77a...

rekor-cli get --uuid 24296fb24b8ad77a... --format json | jq '.body'
```

The Rekor entry is independently witnessed by third parties, so a removed or
tampered attestation in GHCR doesn't erase the historical record.

For build history, the GitHub Actions run logs are public:

```shell
gh run list --repo NVIDIA/aicr --workflow=on-tag.yaml
gh run view <run-id> --repo NVIDIA/aicr --log
```

## 6. In-cluster verification

Verification at `docker pull` time is opt-in per consumer. To make it a
property of the cluster, enforce it with an admission controller. AICR's
images carry **GitHub Artifact Attestations** (Sigstore *bundles*), so the
policy must verify the Sigstore bundle format:

- **Kyverno** — `type: SigstoreBundle`; see
  [Verifying Sigstore Bundles](https://kyverno.io/docs/policy-types/cluster-policy/verify-images/sigstore/#verifying-sigstore-bundles).
  Not yet verified against AICR images — cluster testing returned `no matching
  signatures found`; prefer Policy Controller. See #1537.
- **Sigstore Policy Controller** — requires **v0.13.0+** and
  `signatureFormat: bundle` (see the
  [Sigstore bundle format](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/#sigstore-bundle-format)
  docs); enforcement runs only in namespaces labeled
  `policy.sigstore.dev/include=true`.

Verify against AICR's release identity — issuer
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, subject
`https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/on-tag.yaml@refs/tags/*`.

> Validated, cluster-tested copy-paste policies are tracked in
> [#1537](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/1537). Earlier inline examples
> here used the legacy Cosign format / a pre-bundle Policy Controller version
> and an out-of-scope negative test, so they were removed rather than ship
> policy that silently fails to verify.

## Troubleshooting

**"sigstore verification failed — trusted root may be stale"** — this demo uses `cosign`/`gh`, which manage their own Sigstore TUF roots; run `cosign initialize` to refresh cosign's (not `aicr trust update`).

**`gh attestation verify` returns "no attestations found"** — the artifact predates
the GitHub-attestation rollout (initially shipped in CI mid-2024) or the digest is
wrong. Verify with `cosign verify-attestation` instead, or confirm the digest with
`crane digest`.

**`cosign verify-attestation` returns "no matching attestations"** — the identity
regex is too strict, or the attestation lives on a different artifact (the
attestation is anchored to the OCI manifest digest, and multi-arch images have a
manifest list above the per-arch manifest). Try `cosign tree "${IMAGE_DIGEST}"`
to enumerate what's actually attached.
