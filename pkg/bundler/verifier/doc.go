// Package verifier implements offline bundle verification with a four-level
// trust model.
//
// # Trust Levels
//
// Verification produces one of four trust levels (highest to lowest):
//
//   - verified: The exact bundle inventory and checksums are valid, the bundle
//     attestation is verified, the binary attestation is verified and
//     identity-pinned to NVIDIA CI, and there is no external data.
//   - attested: Full chain verified but external data (--data) was used, capping
//     trust because the data's own provenance is unknown.
//   - unverified: The exact bundle inventory and checksums are valid but no
//     attestation files are present (--attest not used).
//   - unknown: Missing, malformed, incomplete, or unmanaged bundle inventory;
//     invalid checksums; or failed attestation verification.
//
// # Verification Chain
//
// Verify performs a five-step offline verification:
//
//  1. Read checksums.txt once and verify the exact closed-world bundle inventory
//  2. Check for bundle attestation file
//  3. Verify bundle attestation against trusted root, binding to checksums.txt
//     digest and requiring a valid OIDC-issued certificate
//  4. Check for binary attestation file
//  5. Verify binary attestation with identity pinning to NVIDIA CI and binding
//     to the binary digest recorded in the verified bundle attestation
//
// All verification is fully offline using the locally cached or embedded
// Sigstore trusted root. No network calls are made during verification.
//
// # Identity Pinning
//
// Binary attestation verification pins to NVIDIA's GitHub Actions OIDC issuer
// and a repository pattern matching NVIDIA/aicr workflows. This ensures the
// binary was built by NVIDIA CI. The pattern can be overridden via
// VerifyOptions.CertificateIdentityRegexp but must always contain the
// github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/ prefix.
