// Package config defines the AICRConfig file schema accepted by the
// aicr CLI's --config flag on the snapshot, recipe, bundle, and validate
// commands.
//
// AICRConfig is a Kubernetes-style envelope (kind / apiVersion / metadata / spec)
// that lets users capture flag values for these commands in a single YAML or
// JSON document. Each per-command section under spec (snapshot, recipe,
// bundle, validate) is optional, so a config file may populate just one
// section or any combination for end-to-end workflows. CLI flags always
// override values loaded from a config file; for slice/map flags, presence
// on the command line replaces the file's value rather than appending.
//
// Sources are restricted to local file paths and HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
// ConfigMap (cm://) URIs are intentionally rejected: extract the data with
// kubectl and pass the resulting file instead.
//
// Secrets (notably the cosign identity token) are not part of the schema;
// they must be supplied via environment variables or dedicated CLI flags.
